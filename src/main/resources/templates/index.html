            <p><strong>Authentication</strong><br><br>
                Authentication is "the process of verifying the identification of the user or process.
                " The first step is making a claim about identity - the user saying who they are.
                In most systems, this involves the user providing some sort of username.
                Authentication is then the mechanism to determine whether the user really is who they say they are.
                Authentication is generally followed by authorization, or granting permission to access an account,
                information, or set of resources to that user or process. Thus, authentication is a primary means for
                protecting the security and privacy of people's accounts and information. Authentication is also one
                of the most common security mechanisms that users encounter.
